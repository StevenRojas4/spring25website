Which AI tool(s) did you use?
I used ChatGPT to assist with coding for this assignment.

How did it help you?
ChatGPT helped me structure my HTML and CSS files, apply responsive design techniques using the RISEN framework, and incorporate smooth transitions and animations. It also helpede me in refining my navigation layout and ensuring the code followed best practices for accessibility and responsiveness.

What challenges did you encounter?
One challenge I encountered was getting the layout to look correct across all screen sizes. While the AI provided solid suggestions, I still had to adjust spacing, font sizes, as well as the CSS file, and container widths manually to get the exact look I wanted. 

What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?
I learned that AI can be a powerful tool for speeding up development and offering solutions that I might not have thought of on my own. However, it's still important to understand the code and make manual adjustments. AI works best as a collaborative assistant, not a full replacement for learning and applying coding knowledge myself.
